## INTRODUCTION

Our world is filled with the most unique structures that are both man-made and natural. The amazing works of art and architecture known as the Seven Wonders of the World serve as a testament of ingenuity, imagination and sheer hard work of human capability. The number seven was chosen because the Greeks believed it represented perfection and plenty, and because it reflected the number of planets known in ancient times (five) plus the Sun and Moon.

At present, as chosen by the New7Wonders Foundation, the Seven Wonders of the World are the Taj Mahal, the Colosseum, the Chichen Itza, Machu Picchu, Christ the Redeemer, Petra, and the Great Wall of China.
